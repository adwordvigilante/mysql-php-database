DATABASES AND CRUD HOW TO
1. Creating records in the database using PHP in previous lecture. Create table in PHP.

Remember, always pick AI when creating new users in PHPMyAdmin. 

2. Start with Create, now do Read in CRUD. 
    To read data from the database, remember to write a query. SELECT FROM * is the most popular and commonly used. 
    Write a while loop in php like this to grab data and read it in the HTML part of the code: 
        <?php 
            while ($row = mysqli_fetch_row(variable)) {
                print_r(variable); 
            }

        ?>

        Mysqli_fetch_assoc returns associateive arrays if I want to grab one of those values in my code.

        Proper way to do a pre tag in PHP to display data in a more more organized way: 
                <?php
    
        while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) { 
    ?>

        <pre> 

        <?php
        print_r($row); 
        ?>
        
        </pre>

        <?php


        }

        ?>

NEXT VIDEO shows me how to read things from the database and start using functions in PHP to better organize the code. 

For example, I would need to write <?php include .....> in another file and add the PHP connection stuff in the file I'd be referring to. 

From there, it's easy to include HTML, he shows me how to grab ids from PHPMyAdmin like this: 

 while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) { 

          $id =  $row['id']; 

            echo  "<option value='$id'>$id</option>";


 }

Make sure when creating your CRUD app that you use the global variable as well as you're trying to create these databases.


Note, be careful with the way that I have brackets in files like my functions.php file. One little mistake there could cause my whole code to disappear. 
As a point for next time, I can also debug my code by playing around with each component and testing it in the browser to pinpoint where the problem is. 
If it's not anything wrong with the code, check my database in PHPMyAdmin and if that doesn't work, then consult someone for help.  :) 

How to print only one part of database query. It's really easy. Just use this: 

while ($record = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) { 
    print_r($record['value_ive_created_in_phpmyadmin']);
    
}

I may practice this again later today  with making my own third database, but trying to make the values a bit more complex to see if this will also work or not.
